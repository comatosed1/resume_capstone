    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>I enjoy playing a variety of video games. I enjoy fantasy games, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPG) like Star Trek Online, Final Fantasy XIV and some others. I also enjoy playing solo games like the Final Fantasy game series, although Final Fantasy VIII is the only one I have beaten, and I have done it multiple times. I also enjoy the Legend of Zelda series, with Ocarine of Time and Link to the Past as my top two favorites in the series.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Anime and Tokusatsu</h3>
    <p>I am a fan of Japanese anime shows like the Dragon Ball and Mobile Suit Gundam franchises. As a child, I was around when the first Power Rangers series arrived on the scene and as I got older, I started watching and enjoying Super Sentai as well as Kamen Rider and other tokusatsu series.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Gunpla</h3>
    <p>I enjoy Gunpla building. I was introduced to Gundam and model building back in high school by a friend, and after several years away from it, I picked it back up. I have been developing my skills more and more with each model I build. I have competed in the 11th and 12th Gunpla Builder World Cup competitions.</p>

    <h3>Table Top Role Playing Games</h3>
    <p>I participate in a weekly Dungeons and Dragons game with a group of friends. We have been playing together for over five years now. During this time, I have also been a Dungeon Master for the a part of our campaign. This led me to other game systems and currently, I am running a weekly campaign for the Essence20 Power Rangers RPG, through Startplaying.Games.</p>
